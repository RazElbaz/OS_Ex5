# OS_Ex5 Processes

# Introduction:
The final submission will include a stack server (component I) implementing multi
process shared memory and locking routines



## Tasks:
1. Do you still have the stack from ex4? the stack should support:
a. PUSH <text>\n
b. POP\n
c. TOP\n
2. The expected behaviour
a. PUSH will push <text> into the stack.
b. POP will pop text from the stack
c. TOP will display (output) the stack top.
d. Your output should begin with OUTPUT: prefix. These lines are the only lines that will be checked by us. (Your only command that generate output is the TOP
command)
e. For the sake of clarity and simplicity. You may assume that all commands are
only in uppercase. Text includes characters and can be capped at 1024 bytes. You
may add additional commands for operation or debugging. (Such as command for
quitting, displaying stack contents or clearing the stack.) Additionally you may
assume that all commands and text end with a \n (ASCII 10) and that this character
will not be part of the text.
f. You may assume all input is legal and that TOP or POP are only given when
the stack is in non-empty state but encouraged to give error message if you find
illegal command. Use ERROR: <cause> prefix for errors.
g. We will ignore any other prefix for output. However, you are encouraged to use
DEBUG: for debug output.
3. Merge the beej multi process server with the stack implemented in 2.
a. You now serve multiple client that transmit the stack command (instead of
standard input)
4. You should implement locking now as you may receive multiple commands to the
stack on different connections.
use fcntl locking.
5. Practice: implement new methods to manipulate memory (malloc, free) in multi
processes environment. Do not use libc primitives. use mmap MAP_SHARED
Process
shared memory to implement malloc.
6. Final submission: Merge the server implemented in 4 with the components
developed in section 5. You should submit both the server and client.


##  Run:
1. make 
2. run ./server
3. From another terminal open as many terminals as you want and type in # ./client localhost # that the user entered is printed on our server
